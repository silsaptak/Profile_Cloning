# Profile_Cloning
To figure out fake users from the instagram dataset

# Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
fusers.csv — contains data of fake users.
users.csv — contains data of real (genuine) users.
These datasets were combined and preprocessed for classification purposes.

# Approach
Applied cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation.
Multiple machine learning models were trained and tested:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) — achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy.
Naive Bayes (NB) — was the fastest in terms of computation time.
Other models used for comparison include Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression.
